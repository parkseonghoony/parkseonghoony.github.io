Hello, there. Welcome to my website! 👋

This is Seonghoon Park. Just for your information, I'm called Park Seonghoon (박성훈) in Korea.

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. I am also a member of the [Mobile Embedded Systems Lab](https://mobed.yonsei.ac.kr) supervised by Prof. Hojung Cha. I received the B.S. degree in Computer Science from Yonsei University in February 2018.

My research interests include cross-device computing, on-device machine learning, energy-aware mobile systems, and mobile web. I have published several research papers in top conferences such as MobiCom, MobiSys, INFOCOM, and PerCom.

If you'd like to contact me, please email me at [park.s@yonsei.ac.kr](mailto:park.s@yonsei.ac.kr) (primary) or [park@seonghoon.email](mailto:park@seonghoon.email) (secondary).
